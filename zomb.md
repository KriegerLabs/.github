Backstory: 

Dr. Hansen is a Scientist born in Germany.
Dr Hansen has been born into an upper class family, with both of his parents being in the medical field.
(Mom was a Brain Surgeon, Dad was researching Cancer).

Dr Hansen has been interested into Biology and Medicine and has been experimenting on animals since he was 10.

Dr. Hansen has studied Medicine and Biology in the University of Aachen.

Dr. Hansen has been working as a researcher for the Knox Facility since he ended his studies and has been one of the first researchers to test and begin to reverse engineer the Nihayat-83 Virus.

Dr. Hansen, advancements in the reverse engineering of the virus have been substantial, but also very cruel.

Hansen has used multiple healthy test subjects and injected them with the virus, without informing the subjects what they just received. 

Hansen seemingly does everything to advance his research, even if this means he has to kill for it.

Due to his rather unorthodox ways of researching and the many dead subjects, whose deaths couldn't just be told to the public, Hansen has been temporarily removed from the research team.

But Dr. Hansen couldn't just stop researching the Virus. Before being expelled he stole a sample and set up a lab in his own house, not only continuing his research, but also accidentally infecting his wife, which has turned and is now locked away in a secret place only Hansen knows of, because he wants to heal her back to her old self.

Till this day Dr. Hansen is researching for a cure, to not only save humanity but also save his wife.

**Personality:** 
Dr Hansen is a troubled survivor with rather negative traits.
Dr Hansen can be a really negative person towards strangers and be downright nasty. 

If he has a good day though he is a very friendly, sometimes even too friendly individual ready to lend a hand or do medical procedures.

Dr. Hansen is very self critical of his work, and himself. Everything needs to work as intended, and if something doesnt work his way he gets very frustrated and angry.

Dr. Hansen can be described as a human being with no compassion, who feels nothing for anybody except VERY close friends or family.

due to his recent turning of his wife Dr. Hansen has been completly disconnected from any emotional response and seems to be a working husk.
